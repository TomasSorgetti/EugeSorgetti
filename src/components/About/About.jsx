      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        Iâ€™m an eclectic designer who mostly specialises on web/UI Design. I
        found my calling almost by chance while I was studying to be a
        translator.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love a challenge, learning new things, and I am passionate about
        understanding the human mind and creating amazing experiences that solve
        real problems.
